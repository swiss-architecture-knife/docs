# Intro

It is difficult to visualise system and software architecture simply, consistently and sustainably due to its short lifespan. 
Solutions in this area 
- either cost a lot of money
- and/or have no connection to the CMDB or inventory system manor 
- and/or are not suitable for structured documentation purposes
- and/or do not cover all relevant parts of your architecture.

swark on the other hand
- is a free open source solution, focused on the European Union market
- provides an extensible data model for architectural building blocks
- gives you the ability to define reusable documentation structures for different scenarios
- allows you to write documentation via UI or Markdown files

Being realists, we do not claim that we will solve the original problems immediately with swark. But at least we want to try to tackle the underlying technical challenges - organisational and procedural hurdles are a completely different problem.

## Our audience (That's you!)

Let us you give some pithy sentences:

- You have a technical background, coming from a DevOps/software engineer role and evolved into some kind of technical architect role.
- You have been annoyed that there are documentation or information silos due to financial reasons (licensing, seating) and therefore cannot answer your team's questions in a satisfying and time-saving way.
- Putting such sensitive information into some cloud service seems totally fishy to you.
- Even more, why is it so difficult and expensive to pull in data into one of those cloud services?
- Those architecture diagrams are too old and do not reflect the current state.
- Why do I have to repeat the same information for different target group again and again?
- Why is this infrastructure information stored in Excel? And why has it not been updated?
- Where do get those information for our ISO 27001/NIS2/KRITIS/DORA/TISAX certification and how can I make the auditor happy?

Do you recognise yourself in one or more sentences? If so, swark is probably interesting for you.
