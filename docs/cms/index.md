# CMS

swark is not a CMS in a traditional sense: Instead of having a fully fledged editor like in Confluence or WordPress. Instead, you have to write your content either in Markdown or directly HTML. If you need some more dynamic, you can use the Blade templating engine to make your documentation more interactive.
You also do not have any layout builder. If you need want to customize the layout or content structure, you have to make your hands dirty and deal with Laravel.

That being said, swark is _some kind of_ headless CMS.
